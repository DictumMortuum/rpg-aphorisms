*For any conclusion you want the PCs to make, include at least three clues*

[the alexandrian](http://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/1118/roleplaying-games/three-clue-rule)

> Whenever you’re designing a mystery scenario, you should invariably follow the Three Clue Rule:
> For any conclusion you want the PCs to make, include at least three clues.
> Why three? Because the PCs will probably miss the first; ignore the second; and misinterpret the third before making some incredible leap of logic that gets them where you wanted them to go all along.
> I’m kidding, of course. But if you think of each clue as a plan (the PCs will find A, conclude B, and go to C), then when you have three clues you’ve not only got a plan — you’ve also got two backup plans. And when you realize that your plans never survive contact with the players, the need for those backup plans becomes clear.
> In a best case scenario, of course, the players will find all three clues. There’s nothing wrong with that. They can use those clues to confirm their suspicions and reinforce their conclusions (just like Sherlock Holmes).
> In a worst case scenario, they should be able to use at least one of these clues to reach the right conclusion and keep the adventure moving.
> And here’s an important tip: There are no exceptions to the Three Clue Rule.
> “But Justin!” I hear you say. “This clue is really obvious. There is no way the players won’t figure it out.”
> In my experience, you’re probably wrong. For one thing, you’re the one designing the scenario. You already know what the solution to the mystery is. This makes it very difficult for you to objectively judge whether something is obvious or not.
> And even if you’re right, so what? Having extra clues isn’t going to cause any problems. Why not be safe rather than sorry?

# Aphorism 2

*Name your NPCs*

[mattcolville](http://www.dndbeyond.com/forums/dungeons-dragons-discussion/dungeon-masters-only/846-tips-for-a-new-dm)

> Make a list, right now, of male and female names, maybe 10 of each, that you think are appropriate to your setting. Clip it to your GM screen or whatever. Any time you need a name for an NPC, just grab the next one on the list. The goal here is to be able to make up an NPC and instantly know their name. The players will go places and meet people you haven't thought of and if you can say, at the drop of a hat, "The guard's name is Fandrick," it will seem to your players that these NPCs are real people who really exist and you're not just making it all up.

# Aphorism 3

*Throw obstacles at your PCs*

[Laura Backes](http://www.writing-world.com/children/obstacles.shtml) (this piece of advice is for childrens' fiction, but it applies to DMing)

> But in order for a story to be really interesting, your character can't just think of a goal and then effortlessly reach it. As a writer, it's your job to throw obstacles in your character's way.
> By developing obstacles that make sense, you add conflict and tension to the plot. If you progressively raise the stakes for your character throughout the story, you'll keep your readers turning pages to see what happens next.
> The first obstacle your character will encounter is that of the critical situation. This is the point in the beginning of your story at which the character's life changes. Without this critical situation, the character's life would have gone on as before; but with it the character is forced to experience the story's events and challenges. This critical situation should relate directly to the character's goals, creating major shifts in the character's life.
> Once you select the critical situation, get out your list of goals and select several that lend themselves to creating opportunities for relevant obstacles throughout the story. Some of these obstacles can be developed into sub-plots. For example:
> - Does the character have to be somewhere at a specific time? Make him late, or make him miss the appointment altogether.
> - Does the character need to find something? Make the search difficult or fruitless.
> - Does the character need to communicate with someone? Have the note destroyed by weather, stolen by a bad guy or misinterpreted by the receiver.
> - Does the character need to be alone? Make sure she's surrounded by people.

# Aphorism 4

*Appeal to all five of the senses*

[Goblins](http://goblinscomic.com/dungeon-master-tips)

> Telling your players what their characters see around them is the bulk of what a DM does, but don’t forget to explain what their other senses are picking up as well. While you’re explaining the look of the buildings in the city that they just entered, maybe tell them how the city smells. If they’re in a vendor’s area, then you might explain the odour of spices and cooked meats floating through the air. If it’s a nasty side of town, then maybe the stink of urine is hanging about. If they’re creeping through a dank, dungeon hallway, then perhaps they can hear the echoed dripping of water coming from the shadows all around them. If a character wears gloves and the weather is warm, describe the sweaty feeling of the damp leather on his hands. Taped to the inside of my DM screen is a piece of paper that says “sight, smell, taste, touch, sound“. I keep it there to remind me to use whatever senses best fit the description. However, remember to keep you descriptions detailed, but short. Which reminds me…

# Aphorish 5

*Avoid creating intra-character conflict*

[Rich Burlew](http://www.giantitp.com/articles/tll307KmEm4H9k6efFP.html)

> Here's another example: In a campaign I DM'd, the party's bard lifted a magical sword behind the back of the party's Lawful Good monk. The monk had basically decided that the bodies of several fallen knights would be buried without looting, and rather than argue, the bard just grabbed the sword. The bad news was, the sword was cursed; it was the blade that had belonged to a ghost that roamed the castle, and whenever the bard drew it, the ghost materialized and attacked him (and only him). Eventually, the bard 'fessed up that he had stolen the sword. The monk (and the monk's player) became furious, and declared that he could no longer travel with the bard. Either the bard had to leave, or he would. It became a huge argument between characters and players, and it was entirely unnecessary. The monk did not have to react with an ultimatum; the monk did not even have to be angry, no matter what his alignment was. The bard had already suffered the misfortune of having his Charisma drained by the ghost repeatedly; the monk could have chosen (for example) to lecture the bard on how his theft had brought him nothing but misery. He chose to create player conflict when it was just as easy to not.
