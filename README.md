# Aphorism 1

*For any conclusion you want the PCs to make, include at least three clues*

[the alexandrian](http://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/1118/roleplaying-games/three-clue-rule)

> Whenever you’re designing a mystery scenario, you should invariably follow the Three Clue Rule:
> For any conclusion you want the PCs to make, include at least three clues.
> Why three? Because the PCs will probably miss the first; ignore the second; and misinterpret the third before making some incredible leap of logic that gets them where you wanted them to go all along.
> I’m kidding, of course. But if you think of each clue as a plan (the PCs will find A, conclude B, and go to C), then when you have three clues you’ve not only got a plan — you’ve also got two backup plans. And when you realize that your plans never survive contact with the players, the need for those backup plans becomes clear.
> In a best case scenario, of course, the players will find all three clues. There’s nothing wrong with that. They can use those clues to confirm their suspicions and reinforce their conclusions (just like Sherlock Holmes).
> In a worst case scenario, they should be able to use at least one of these clues to reach the right conclusion and keep the adventure moving.
> And here’s an important tip: There are no exceptions to the Three Clue Rule.
> “But Justin!” I hear you say. “This clue is really obvious. There is no way the players won’t figure it out.”
> In my experience, you’re probably wrong. For one thing, you’re the one designing the scenario. You already know what the solution to the mystery is. This makes it very difficult for you to objectively judge whether something is obvious or not.
> And even if you’re right, so what? Having extra clues isn’t going to cause any problems. Why not be safe rather than sorry?

# Aphorism 2

*Name your NPCs*

[mattcolville](http://www.dndbeyond.com/forums/dungeons-dragons-discussion/dungeon-masters-only/846-tips-for-a-new-dm)

> Make a list, right now, of male and female names, maybe 10 of each, that you think are appropriate to your setting. Clip it to your GM screen or whatever. Any time you need a name for an NPC, just grab the next one on the list. The goal here is to be able to make up an NPC and instantly know their name. The players will go places and meet people you haven't thought of and if you can say, at the drop of a hat, "The guard's name is Fandrick," it will seem to your players that these NPCs are real people who really exist and you're not just making it all up.

# Aphorism 3

*Throw obstacles at your PCs*

[Laura Backes](http://www.writing-world.com/children/obstacles.shtml) (this piece of advice is for childrens' fiction, but it applies to DMing)

> But in order for a story to be really interesting, your character can't just think of a goal and then effortlessly reach it. As a writer, it's your job to throw obstacles in your character's way.
> By developing obstacles that make sense, you add conflict and tension to the plot. If you progressively raise the stakes for your character throughout the story, you'll keep your readers turning pages to see what happens next.
> The first obstacle your character will encounter is that of the critical situation. This is the point in the beginning of your story at which the character's life changes. Without this critical situation, the character's life would have gone on as before; but with it the character is forced to experience the story's events and challenges. This critical situation should relate directly to the character's goals, creating major shifts in the character's life.
> Once you select the critical situation, get out your list of goals and select several that lend themselves to creating opportunities for relevant obstacles throughout the story. Some of these obstacles can be developed into sub-plots. For example:
> - Does the character have to be somewhere at a specific time? Make him late, or make him miss the appointment altogether.
> - Does the character need to find something? Make the search difficult or fruitless.
> - Does the character need to communicate with someone? Have the note destroyed by weather, stolen by a bad guy or misinterpreted by the receiver.
> - Does the character need to be alone? Make sure she's surrounded by people.

# Aphorism 4

*Appeal to all five of the senses*

[Goblins](http://goblinscomic.com/dungeon-master-tips)

> Telling your players what their characters see around them is the bulk of what a DM does, but don’t forget to explain what their other senses are picking up as well. While you’re explaining the look of the buildings in the city that they just entered, maybe tell them how the city smells. If they’re in a vendor’s area, then you might explain the odour of spices and cooked meats floating through the air. If it’s a nasty side of town, then maybe the stink of urine is hanging about. If they’re creeping through a dank, dungeon hallway, then perhaps they can hear the echoed dripping of water coming from the shadows all around them. If a character wears gloves and the weather is warm, describe the sweaty feeling of the damp leather on his hands. Taped to the inside of my DM screen is a piece of paper that says “sight, smell, taste, touch, sound“. I keep it there to remind me to use whatever senses best fit the description. However, remember to keep you descriptions detailed, but short. Which reminds me…

# Aphorism 5

*Avoid creating intra-character conflict*

[Rich Burlew](http://www.giantitp.com/articles/tll307KmEm4H9k6efFP.html)

> Here's another example: In a campaign I DM'd, the party's bard lifted a magical sword behind the back of the party's Lawful Good monk. The monk had basically decided that the bodies of several fallen knights would be buried without looting, and rather than argue, the bard just grabbed the sword. The bad news was, the sword was cursed; it was the blade that had belonged to a ghost that roamed the castle, and whenever the bard drew it, the ghost materialized and attacked him (and only him). Eventually, the bard 'fessed up that he had stolen the sword. The monk (and the monk's player) became furious, and declared that he could no longer travel with the bard. Either the bard had to leave, or he would. It became a huge argument between characters and players, and it was entirely unnecessary. The monk did not have to react with an ultimatum; the monk did not even have to be angry, no matter what his alignment was. The bard had already suffered the misfortune of having his Charisma drained by the ghost repeatedly; the monk could have chosen (for example) to lecture the bard on how his theft had brought him nothing but misery. He chose to create player conflict when it was just as easy to not.

# Aphorism 6

*Avoid 'my guy' syndrome*

[Alex P](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/a/37105/2968)

> "My Guy" syndrome is when — often unwittingly — you disclaim decision-making power and responsibility by acting like "what my character would do" is inevitable and inviolable, even if it gets in the way of actually having fun in the game or being able to play the game at all.

# Aphorism 7

*Your stories should have a beginning, a middle and an end*

[Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramatic_structure) This was written about the ancient tragedy, however the dramatic structure it describes can be applied to any story. Of course this is not to say that you should not improvise, but keep in mind that your stories and sideplots should have a feeling of completeness.

> Aristotle stated that the tragedy should imitate a whole action, which means that the events follow each other by probability or necessity, and that the causal chain has a beginning and an end. There is a knot, a central problem that the protagonist must face. The play has two parts: complication and unravelling. During complication, the protagonist finds trouble as the knot is revealed or tied; during unraveling, the knot is resolved.

# Aphorism 8

*Avoid breaking suspension of disbelief*

[tvtropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief). Immersion is when the players' suspension of disbelief is at its strongest.

> An author's work, in other words, does not have to be realistic, only believable and internally consistent (even the last requirement can be relieved to some extent). When the author pushes an audience beyond what they're willing to accept, the work fails in the eyes of that particular audience. As far as science fiction is concerned, viewers are usually willing to go along with creative explanations which is why people don't criticize your wormhole travel system or how a shrinking potion doesn't violate the laws of matter conservation, but even in the more fantastical genres, suspension of disbelief can be broken when a work breaks its own established laws or asks the audience to put up with too many things that come off as contrived.

> A common way of putting this is "You can ask an audience to believe the impossible, but not the improbable." For example, people will accept that the Grand Mage can teleport across the world, or that the spaceship has technology that makes it completely invisible without rendering its own sensors blind, but they won't accept that the ferocious carnivore just happened to have a heart attack and die right before it attacked the main character, or that the hacker guessed his enemy's password on the first try just by typing random letters, at least without some prior detail justifying it or one of the Rules listed below coming into play. What is in Real Life impossible just has to be made the norm in the setting and kept consistent.

# Aphorism 9

*Build a cast of ready made NPCs*

[Chris Fox](https://www.rpg.net/columns/evilgmfundamentals/evilgmfundamentals2.phtml)

> This method is great, but what if your well of inspiration is feeling a little dry? In last month's article we covered an exercise to adapt scenes from your favorite movie or book into your campaign. You can do the same thing with characters, and if anything its even easier.

> When watching a movie you really like take a good look at a character you want to include in your campaign. Ask yourself the questions above. Try looking for mannerisms, facial expressions or phrases the character uses. Jot those down in a notebook until you have a few paragraphs about the character. Then, sit down and modify him to fit your game. Do this every time you see someone cool in a movie.

> Before you know it you'll have an assortment of NPCs who can fill all sorts of different roles in your game. If you need a random innkeeper, mayor or stable master take a look at your notes and see if you've built a profile to match. In most cases you will, and if you don't you can often adapt a profile by changing it to match what you need.

# Aphorism 10

*Reuse NPCs when possible*

[Katrina Ostrander](https://geekandsundry.com/how-to-integrate-character-backstories-into-rpg-campaigns/)

> If your players sprinkled names or characters into their backstory, don’t let them fall to the wayside. Record their names and relationship, and refer back to them when it comes time to see who can help or hinder your group during a given task. As the players seek out shopkeepers, sources of information, or trainers over the course of the campaign, why create a new character when an existing NPC will do?

# Aphorism 11

*Keep your players motivated*

[Chris Perkins](http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/whats-my-motivation)

> Breathing life into a D&D player character is the player's job, but keeping the character motivated and relevant is something the DM and player hash out together. It's a little bit like developing a television character. In television, you hire an actor to become a character, and once an actor is comfortable wearing that character's skin, the character takes on a life of its own. However, when the character is being underserved or its purpose called into question, the actor will often turn to the show's writers for ideas. Working together, the writers and actor can find new and clever ways to tie the character into whatever else is happening in the show.

# Aphorism 12

*Thou shalt not afflict players with thine own awe-inspiring characters*

[yandros](http://www.mit.edu/afs.new/sipb/user/yandros/rpg/gm-sins.txt)

> Deadly Sin #1: Thou shalt not afflict players with thine own awe-inspiring characters. Don't send one of your own really kool characters with the PCs. Avoid the temptation!  Yes, yes, I know the PCs will sit in awe of the astounding skill levels and powers your totally kickbutt character has and that they will be thrilled by all the stories of the world shaking events the character has been involved with and they will be stunned by the astoundingly powerful array of magical artifacts the character has collected.  But give the PCs a chance to use their own pitiful skills, pathetic powers, and mundane equipment!

> If lack of players or other reasons require extra party members, run them as background, an extra Intelligence check, or just another guy to go along.  Play them with character, but never allow them to make decisions that will affect the PC's.  This only happens when the PC's don't see a clue that is smack DAB in their faces. Also, NPCs are always last to get the new equipment.

> Corollary to #1: Thou shalt not afflict players with awe inspiring omnipotent artifacts.  Never *ever* give the players that ever-so-cool magical item you created that has all those super powers and abilities and its intelligent and can kill deities in one stroke. Regardless of who you give it to, it is going to get hideously abused at some point. Give magic to match the characters.

# Aphorism 13

*Thou shalt not place thy plot above player wishes*

[yandros](http://www.mit.edu/afs.new/sipb/user/yandros/rpg/gm-sins.txt)

> Deadly Sin #9: Thou shalt not place thy plot above player wishes. Never let your precious, inflexible storyline screw up good characters. Nobody likes to be railroaded.

> Railroading has gotten a bad name.  There are many games out there that advertise themselves as "storytelling" that often demand that the characters don't screw things up.  Killing the main bad guy in the first session is bad.  GMs just need to fudge things a little to "naturally" keep the plot on track.

> The idea isn't that they don't HAVE free will, they do. They are just made aware of the risks involved in attempting it (and failing) are grave. They are quite free to make those 4 drive rolls you mention, and perhaps die in a fiery automobile crash, but it's up to them. Of course everyone knows that in REALITY they aren't going to do it.

# Aphorism 14

*Thou shalt not display preferential treatment*

[yandros](http://www.mit.edu/afs.new/sipb/user/yandros/rpg/gm-sins.txt)

> Deadly Sin #11: Thou shalt not display preferential treatment. Don't always pick out one member of the party and make the campaign center tightly around that person. Don't ignore efforts on the part of other players to carve out a niche for themselves in the campaign.

> Whatever you do, don't ever display favoritism to anyone in your game!  I don't care if this is your girl/boyfriend, husband/wife, best friend from waaaay back JUST DON'T DO IT!  Nothing ticks off players more than a perceived bias on the GM's part for (or even against, if unjustified!) another player.  If you can't be impartial, for political reasons or otherwise, in your treatment of a specific player, don't invite that player to games involving other players. If you can't leave out the player (by virtue, say, of being married to him or her), don't run games. You'll lose your players in the end anyway, so what's the point?

> Special corollary:  The above takes on critical importance if you find the player in question attractive.

> Corollary to the corollary:  Exercise extreme caution if the player's significant other is also in the party.....

# Aphorism 15

*Be open to cooperation*

[Alex](https://www.cherrypickedgames.com/role-playing/2015/9/25/problematic-players)

> We’ve all played in a campaign with this character. They are the natural loner with distrust of authority, teams, and other people in general. At best, they are contrary to the game master’s characters and slow down story progression. At worst, they split off from the party to have their own exciting adventures, leaving the rest of the crew out of focus and bored. Unfortunately, this loner persona is an easy one to develop for players of all skill levels. The genre often promotes ideas of tragic backstories or segregation from normal society. These characters are interesting, but playing them is more challenging than it appears.

> The problem is a lack of cooperation. Help this player build bonds with others. There’s a natural story arc of the loner character learning to care about and love their party. They become the family that never accepted them or they never had. It may seem clichéd, but it’s a sturdy plot development to continue character growth. This acceptance plays out differently each time. Whether the loner is saved by a fellow adventurer or the whole party is pitted against the world and not cooperating is suicide, the group can come to a nice harmony.

> One of our regular Catalyst players, Jared, averts the Lone Wolf behavior well. The character of his that comes to mind is Dan, a gruff ex-soldier brimming with hate and frustration. Dan was stuck with two high school misfits (we made our characters independently…) and forced into the role of a competent leader. Rather than dismissing the obnoxious children around him, Jared decided to endow his character with parental instinct. No one else could whip Aiden and Bryawn into shape, so Dan reluctantly took them under his wing. Despite the repeated insults and death threats, he cared about them.

# Aphorism 16

*The seven basic plots*

[Christopher Booker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Basic_Plots)

> **Overcoming the Monster**
> The protagonist sets out to defeat an antagonistic force (often evil) which threatens the protagonist and/or protagonist's homeland.
> Examples: Perseus, Theseus, Beowulf, Dracula, The War of the Worlds, Nicholas Nickleby, The Guns of Navarone, Seven Samurai and its Western-style remake The Magnificent Seven, the James Bond franchise, and Star Wars: A New Hope.[2]

> **Rags to Riches**
> The poor protagonist acquires things such as power, wealth, and a mate, before losing it all and gaining it back upon growing as a person.
> Examples: Cinderella, Aladdin, Jane Eyre, A Little Princess, Great Expectations, David Copperfield, The Prince and the Pauper, Brewster's Millions.[2]

> **The Quest**
> The protagonist and some companions set out to acquire an important object or to get to a location, facing many obstacles and temptations along the way.
> Examples: Odyssey, The Pilgrim’s Progress, King Solomon's Mines, Watership Down,[2] The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, The Land Before Time, One Piece, the Indiana Jones franchise, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle

> **Voyage and Return**
> The protagonist goes to a strange land and, after overcoming the threats it poses to him or her, returns with experience.
> Examples: Odyssey, Ramayana, Alice in Wonderland, Goldilocks and the Three Bears, Orpheus, The Time Machine, Peter Rabbit, The Hobbit, Mad Max: Fury Road, Brideshead Revisited, The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Gone with the Wind, The Third Man,[2] Chronicles of Narnia, Apollo 13, Labyrinth, Finding Nemo, Gulliver's Travels, Spirited Away, Uncharted, The Wizard of Oz. Back To The Future.

> **Comedy**
> Light and humorous character with a happy or cheerful ending; a dramatic work in which the central motif is the triumph over adverse circumstance, resulting in a successful or happy conclusion.[3] Booker makes sure to stress that comedy is more than humor. It refers to a pattern where the conflict becomes more and more confusing, but is at last made plain in a single clarifying event. Most romances fall into this category.
> Examples: A Midsummer Night's Dream, Much Ado About Nothing, Twelfth Night, Bridget Jones's Diary, Music and Lyrics, Sliding Doors, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Mr. Bean

> **Tragedy**
> The protagonist is a hero with one major character flaw or great mistake which is ultimately their undoing. Their unfortunate end evokes pity at their folly and the fall of a fundamentally 'good' character.
> Examples: Macbeth, The Picture of Dorian Gray, Carmen, Bonnie and Clyde, Jules et Jim, Anna Karenina, Madame Bovary, John Dillinger, Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar,[2] Death Note, Breaking Bad, Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry, Hamlet, Beowulf, The Room

> **Rebirth**
> During the course of the story, an important event forces the main character to change their ways, often making them a better person.
> Examples: The Frog Prince, Beauty and the Beast, The Snow Queen, A Christmas Carol, The Secret Garden, Peer Gynt,[2] Life Is a Dream, Despicable Me, Machine Gun Preacher, Megamind, How the Grinch Stole Christmas

## Story

A narrative or story is a report of connected events, real or imaginary, presented in a sequence of written or spoken words, or still or moving images, or both. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative)

## Plot

Plot refers to the sequence of events inside a story which affect other events through the principle of cause and effect. The causal events of a plot can be thought of as a series of sentences linked by "and so". Plots can vary from simple structures such as in a traditional ballad to complex interwoven structures sometimes referred to as an imbroglio. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plot_(narrative))

## Suspension of disbelief

The term suspension of disbelief or willing suspension of disbelief has been defined as a willingness to suspend one's critical faculties and believe something surreal; sacrifice of realism and logic for the sake of enjoyment. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief)
