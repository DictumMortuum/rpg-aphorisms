> Whenever you’re designing a mystery scenario, you should invariably follow the Three Clue Rule:
> For any conclusion you want the PCs to make, include at least three clues.
> Why three? Because the PCs will probably miss the first; ignore the second; and misinterpret the third before making some incredible leap of logic that gets them where you wanted them to go all along.
> I’m kidding, of course. But if you think of each clue as a plan (the PCs will find A, conclude B, and go to C), then when you have three clues you’ve not only got a plan — you’ve also got two backup plans. And when you realize that your plans never survive contact with the players, the need for those backup plans becomes clear.
> In a best case scenario, of course, the players will find all three clues. There’s nothing wrong with that. They can use those clues to confirm their suspicions and reinforce their conclusions (just like Sherlock Holmes).
> In a worst case scenario, they should be able to use at least one of these clues to reach the right conclusion and keep the adventure moving.
> And here’s an important tip: There are no exceptions to the Three Clue Rule.
> “But Justin!” I hear you say. “This clue is really obvious. There is no way the players won’t figure it out.”
> In my experience, you’re probably wrong. For one thing, you’re the one designing the scenario. You already know what the solution to the mystery is. This makes it very difficult for you to objectively judge whether something is obvious or not.
> And even if you’re right, so what? Having extra clues isn’t going to cause any problems. Why not be safe rather than sorry?
